# MINESHA Onboarding Platform — Developer Reference

## What This Is

Peace-driven leadership coaching platform. Guides clients through a proprietary 4-phase transformation pathway called "The Peace-Driven Leader™" — from burnout to breakthrough via Mind, Body, and Divine Identity work.

**Primary flows:**
1. Public visitor → signup → plan selection → pending approval → active dashboard → 4-phase onboarding journey
2. Admin monitors clients, manages subscriptions, tracks progress

## Auth System

JWT in HTTP-only cookie `auth_token` (7-day expiry).

```typescript
// JWT payload
{ userId: string, email: string, role: "admin" | "client" }
```

**Guards:**
- `lib/auth.ts` → `requireAuth()` — verify token, return userId
- `lib/adminAuth.ts` → `requireAdmin()` — verify token + check role === "admin"

Call these at the top of every protected API route.

---

## Data Models

### User
```typescript
{
  email, password (hashed),
  firstName, lastName,
  addressLine1, addressLine2?,
  city, stateProvince, zipCode, countryRegion,
  phoneNumber,
  role: "admin" | "client",          // default: "client"
  accountStatus: "unsubscribed" | "pending" | "active",
  plan: "basic" | "intermediate" | "custom" | null,
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

### OnboardingProfile
Tracks the 4-phase journey. Nested document per user.

```typescript
{
  userId,
  currentPhase: 1–4,
  currentStep: "1A"–"4C",   // 17 total steps
  isCompleted: boolean,
  hasSeenCelebration: boolean,

  // Phase 1 — Connection
  snapshot, gettingToKnowYou (13 fields), triage (9 domains × 5 Qs), orientation,

  // Phase 2 — Awareness
  evaluations360, growthInputs, eveningPulse, rhythmSnapshot, bossIndex, homeAudit,

  // Phase 3 — Stabilization
  visionActivation, visionStatements, idealDayNarrative, wordOfYear, familyMission,

  // Phase 4 — Activation
  kickstartCallBooked, telegramJoined, wealthStrategyComplete
}
```

## User Status Lifecycle

```
unsubscribed → (select plan) → pending → (admin approves) → active
```

Currently **manual** — admin must manually change status to active. Stripe webhooks not wired up yet.

## Caching Strategy

Upstash Redis with TTLs:
- Admin stats: 300s (5 min)
- Client lists: 60s
- Location data: 3600s (1 hr)

Cache keys follow pattern: `admin:stats`, `admin:clients:page:N`, etc.

## What's Done

- Authentication (signup/login/logout/JWT cookies)
- User + OnboardingProfile schemas
- Plan selection + pending state
- Landing page
- Plans page with Stripe links
- Dashboard with progress tracking
- Admin dashboard with stats, charts, subscription data
- Multi-step signup with full validation (country/city autocomplete, Terms modal)
- Location services APIs
- Welcome celebration sequence (Lottie, confetti, YouTube embeds)
- Redis caching layer
- Admin client management (list, filter, sort, stale detection at 7 days)
- Settings endpoints (profile, password)
- Subscriptions management page

## What's NOT Done / In Progress

### Critical (blocks production)

1. **Stripe Webhook** — Payments do NOT auto-activate accounts. Admin must manually set `accountStatus = active`. Need to implement `/api/webhooks/stripe` that listens for `checkout.session.completed`, verifies signature, and updates user status.

2. **Email Pipeline** — Resend API key exists but zero sending logic. Need emails for: signup confirmation, pending approval notification, account activated, step completion nudges.


### Medium Priority

5. **Rate Limiting** — No brute-force protection on `/api/auth/login` or `/api/auth/signup`. Add middleware-level rate limiting (consider `@upstash/ratelimit` — already have Redis).

6. **ProTeam Messaging** — UI button exists in dashboard but no backend. Admin–client messaging not implemented.

7. **Email Notifications on Status Change** — When admin approves an account (status → active), user should get an email. No trigger exists.

8. **Stale Threshold Config** — Hardcoded to 7 days in admin stats. Should be admin-configurable.

9. **Admin Pagination Limit** — Currently caps at 50 clients. May need cursor-based pagination for scale.

## Development Notes

- Default theme is **dark**. Toggle with next-themes `ModeToggle`.
- Primary brand color: gold `#b6954a`.
- Step IDs are strings ("1A", "2B"...). Treat as opaque IDs — schema relies on them.
- `SignupForm.tsx` is large (~1200 lines). Be careful editing; it owns validation state for all 3 steps.
- Admin routes return cached responses — bust cache manually in Redis if testing live data changes.
- MongoDB Atlas requires your IP in the whitelist. If queries hang locally, check Atlas network access.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in all vars
npm run dev                  # Turbopack dev server
```

Admin account: create a user in MongoDB directly and set `role: "admin"`.
